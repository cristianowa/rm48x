This project is the source code used in my Graduation Thesis.

It uses the RM48x Hercules Safety Critical Microcontroller with the HalCoGen Software provided by Texas Instruments.

There are branchs for each IDE used ( IAR, Keil and CCS). There are also a branch for FreeRTOS and other for LWIP.

The Keil and LWIP branch are not functional.

Since I don't have the development board anymore, the project is stopped. Please send any patch if you find a mistake.
